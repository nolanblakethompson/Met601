            <h2> <i class="bi bi-chat-right-heart-fill" style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: rgb(249, 254, 221);"> </i>  Hi!  </h2>
            <p> 
                I grew up in Charlotte, NC (and a little in south georgia) in a big, loud, and loyal southern family. 
                I spent my childhood loving art, fueling my decision to leave the south to pursue a creative career. 
                I started drawing before I could walk, so it has always been something intrinsically tied to the way I understand 
                the world. 

                I love people, food, music, and authenticity within everything! I care a lot about the impact I have on the world on a 
                day to day basis and I am always looking to learn new things.
            </p>

            <h2> 
                <i class="bi bi-rocket-takeoff-fill" style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: rgb(249, 254, 221);"> </i> 
                So a little bit about what I got going on right now...  
            </h2>

            <p> 
                I graduated from Boston University in May 2024 and promptly began my post baccalaureate fellowship in project management for 
                Spark! at CDS. I a manage the user experience practicum and software engineering practicum, which has been a blast. Our projects have really significant social impact, 
                led by clients who truly care about their work. I enjoy teaching and managing students, finding myself constantly blown away by the work produced.   

                I am figuring out what I want to do next through this fellowship, also pursuing my masters in software development. I love branding, UX design, front-end dev, and project management. 
                However, the main things I am looking for in my next job is a company with a positive social impact. 
    
                Through pursuing my BFA in graphic design and a BS in advertising, I developed a love for creating visual 
                identities and systems. With a desire to deeply understand creative problem solving and explore emerging design tools
                further, I emersed myself into the intersection of tech and design. Through completing computer science courses 
                and UX/UI courses, I fine-tuned my skills in interaction design and creative coding. I find strength in collaboration, 
                experimentation, and empathy. I believe in designing systems, tools, and artifacts that honor humanity through 
                critique, transparency, and joy.
